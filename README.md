# What I Need : W.I.N

This project has been created with ViteJS (you can use npm run dev)


## Some context

This project is the second group project of the Wild Code School bootcamp. This project lasted a month and was created within a team of 4 people : Melissa Olas, Mounir Asri, Matthieu Lemarchand and I, Ambre Thevenin. 

Rules for this project : create a React project using at least one API. 

## The project

W.I.N is a mobile website that helps the user in their morning commute. The idea is simple : why use several apps in the morning to get prepared for your day, when you can use W.I.N ? 

When arriving for the first time on the website, the user is prompted to enter a name, and addresses. 
The addresses then allow the 4 modules to update data : 
 - The first module is the SNCF module : to be sure to make it to work on time, the user can have a look at the quickest commute offered by the SNCF. 
 - Then, the user can see the Weather forecast for the next 8 hours, and make sure to be dressed accordingly
 - The user may also check on the supermarket nearest to their workplace, to make sure they can grab a snack or breakfast for the team on the way
 - Lastly, we wanted to include a private joke, a module that can display one of our classmate's finest jokes to entertain them during the commute. 


The WIN project uses RESTful APIs :
- Navitia (for SNCF journey info and shops info)
- OpenWeatherMap 
- Nominatim from OpenStreetMap (for geocoding)
